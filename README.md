ECE324 Course Project
Code for the Deep Q Learning Model can be found in the test_agent.py and custom_dqn files. PPO_template.ipynb contains the PPO RL model.

## Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/diambra/diambraArena.git
cd diambraArena
./setupOS.sh
pip3 install .
```
After cloning the diambraArena repository, you'll need to download the ROM for DEAD OR ALIVE ++ [JAPAN].
Afterwards, you should be able to run the files in /models.

## test_agent.py
To run this, put the file into the examples folder after setting up the diambra environment and downloading the rom for the doapp game, modify line 8 by putting your devices' path to the directory containing the downloaded game rom.
